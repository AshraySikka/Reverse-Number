# Reverse-Number & Palindrome Checker

This Python program takes an integer input from the user, reverses the number, and checks whether the original number is a **palindrome**.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Reverses the digits of a given integer.
- Compares the reversed number with the original number.
- Determines if the number is a **palindrome** (reads the same forward and backward).

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Takes user input (`n`) as an integer.
2. Initializes `rev` (reverse) to 0 and stores the original number in `num`.
3. Uses a `while` loop to reverse the number.
4. Compares the reversed number to the original:
   - If they are equal: outputs **"Palindrome"**
   - Otherwise: outputs **"Not Palindrome"**

## ▶️ Sample Run

Enter a number: 121
Reverse of 121 is 121
Palindrome

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `reverse_palindrome.py`) and run:

```bash
python reverse-palindrome.py
